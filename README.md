# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Typing Speed Test

Welcome to my Typing Speed Test website! This project is designed to measure and improve your typing speed. Below you will find detailed information about the technologies used, file structure, responsiveness, and how to access the website.

## Why I Use React Framework

I chose React for this project due to its component-based architecture, which allows for reusable and maintainable code. React's virtual DOM ensures efficient updates and rendering, leading to a smoother user experience. Additionally, React's rich ecosystem and community support make it an excellent choice for building modern web applications.

## Is the Website Responsive?

YES, the website is responsive. It adapts to different viewports, ensuring a consistent experience across various devices.

The project is organized into several components and directories for better maintainability:

less

src/components: Contains all React components, such as SpeedTypingGame and TypingArea.
src/styles: Includes CSS modules for styling components.
public: Public assets and the main HTML file.

Main Components

less

    App.js: The root component that includes the main layout.
    SpeedTypingGame.js: Manages game state and logic, including paragraph generation and user input.
    TypingArea.js: Renders typing area and stats, tracks time, mistakes, and provides a reset button.

## How to Access the Website

Currently, I haven't hosted my website anywhere as it is in development. But in the future, I will surely host it and will update the things on this repo.

Clone the Repository

bash
```
git clone https://github.com/akshatrajsaxena/typing-speed-test.git

## What is the Purpose of This Website?

The purpose of this website is to help users measure and improve their typing speed. It serves as a fun and interactive tool for practice and improvement.

#React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

    @vitejs/plugin-react uses Babel for Fast Refresh
    @vitejs/plugin-react-swc uses SWC for Fast Refresh

Welcome to my Typing Speed Test code, the build of the code is done mainly in Javascript using React Framework.
